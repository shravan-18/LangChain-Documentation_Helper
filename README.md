An end-to-end application I developed using Langchain that serves as a documentation assistant for the Langchain library, and it also integrates relevant external data related to Langchain using OpenAI. 

This repository contains a project I've created with the Langchain framework. It assists with documentation purposes related to the Langchain Library (eg: "How do I implement embeddings using OpenAIEmbeddings with Langchain?"). It can also suggest information sources from outside the documentation (eg: A related YouTube video addressing a similar issue the user may be facing, information about a person of interest related to Langchain, etc).

## Code
